## Additional feedback

Awesome job on this project, seems like there is a good distribution of work. The documentation is also **awesome**! Couple quick things. There is an unresolved merge conflict in the code! I would make sure your master branch is the clean one -- its where employers will look. I have some inline code comments, but I would also recommend using container components! On a visual level, I would add some more padding to the site so that there is more room on the sides of the page. I would also not use so much text on the homepage and instead make the UI demonstrate the information inline (such as details on forms for different TODO levels). Let me know if you have other questions or want feedback on something specific!
